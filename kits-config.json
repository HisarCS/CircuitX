      "detailedDescription": "In the scope of the new technological era we live in, creative learning, prototyping and innovative problem solving are increasing in value day by day. However, newcomers in K12 laboratories find it quite challenging to take on new projects by themselves. Our observations in STEM projects and robotics competitions revealed a significant gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications in mechanical systems. Aiming to find a constructive way to fill this gap, we prototyped kits labeled \"automata\". Creativity can enhance the hands-on multidisciplinary learning experience by drawing interest in the process of creating a unique outcome.",
